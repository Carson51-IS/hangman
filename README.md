External Dependencies:
  I would have been unable to complete the assignment in the front end coding languages that I am familiar with. 
  So, for this assignment I watched about 3 hours of a python tutorial and wrote the code in a relatively new programming language for me. 
  I was able to complete the game of hangman based off of what I had learned in the video with minimal use of external websites, and no 
  use of AI. However, in my code I use a dictionary to complete a portion of the code. I learned this from my sister who is a programmer.
  Keep in mind that she did not make a dictionary for me. I sat at her house for 3 hours as she described what a dictionary in python is,
  and how it can be applied in my code. I did all of the programming.

Time spent:
  Due to the time that I had to spend actually learning what I was doing I would assume close to 10 hours to complete the game of hangman.
  If only time working on the code counts I would say closer to 5 hours possibly a little bit more.
